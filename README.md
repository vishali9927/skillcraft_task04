# 🚧 Accident Data Visualization

This project analyzes and visualizes accident data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It extracts time-based insights, weather conditions, road types, and geospatial distributions to help understand accident patterns and potential hotspots.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

1. **Accidents by Hour of Day**
2. **Accidents by Day of the Week**
3. **Correlation Heatmap of Numerical Features**
4. **Accidents by Weather Condition**
5. **Accidents by Road Condition**
6. **Accident Location Hotspots (Latitude vs Longitude)**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization

## 📁 Dataset

Ensure your CSV file (e.g., `Sample_accident_data.csv`) contains the following relevant columns:

- `Date` – Datetime of accident
- `Latitude` and `Longitude` – Geolocation
- `Severity` – Severity level of the accident
- `Weather_Condition` – Weather at the time of accident
- `Road_Condition` – Road status
- Any other numerical columns for correlation analysis
